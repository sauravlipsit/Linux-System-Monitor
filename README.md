### 🌐 Step 4: Showcase in Your Resume / Interview
You can now say something like this:

> **Project:** System Monitor Tool (C++ & Linux)  
> - Developed a real-time system performance monitor using C++.  
> - Collected system metrics from the `/proc` filesystem and displayed CPU, memory, and process usage.  
> - Implemented periodic data logging and top process tracking.  
> - Deployed on GitHub with detailed documentation.

✅ Tip: Take a **screenshot** of your tool running in the terminal and include it in your README or PPT!

### 🧱 Step 5 (Optional): Make It Interactive
If you want to impress more:
- Add a **menu** (press 1 to show CPU, 2 for Memory, etc.)
- Or use `ncurses` library for a more dynamic terminal UI (like `top`).

Would you like me to give you the **next version of the code** that adds those features (top 5 processes, disk usage, temperature, and log saving)?  
It’ll make your project look professional and complete.
